Data integration is a vast area and a key components of many data-centric activities. Here, I will focus on listing examples of particular educational value.

* [Space for US](https://www.nasa.gov/SpaceforUS/) &mdash; public engagement initiative by NASA with state-by-state stories on how NASA activities have local impact, e.g.
  - Delaware: [Steering Clear of Endangered Fish with NASA Data](https://www.nasa.gov/SpaceforUS/stories/de.html)
    - > "The project team integrated environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, sea floor topography, and ocean color data—with the acoustic tagging observations, to help track and forecast adult sturgeon swimming through Delaware waters. With this information, the team developed the Atlantic Sturgeon Forecast Warning System, a free, publicly accessible “heads-up” for avoiding costly interactions. This system, which can deliver messages through a web application, online flyers, or text-based updates to a mobile device, alerts interested parties to the risk of encountering sturgeon in the Delaware River and Bay, and even issues a risk forecast three days out."
  - Virginia: [Helping Cities Stay Dry When Sea Levels Rise](https://www.nasa.gov/SpaceforUS/stories/va.html)
    - > "By integrating the Irene simulations with Earth-observing data and imagery, Loftis and his teams developed a new, high-resolution flood tool called the “street-level model.” The model allows users to track the relative sea-level rise expected throughout Hampton Roads through 2045 and can simulate the effects of another “Irene” under those changing conditions. With this model, city planners and emergency managers can pinpoint various flood scenarios—down to the building level."
