Data integration is a vast area and a key components of many data-centric activities. Here, I will focus on listing examples of particular educational value.

  - > "The project team integrated environmental variables such as sea surface temperature, sea floor topography, and ocean color data—with the acoustic tagging observations, to help track and forecast adult sturgeon swimming through Delaware waters. With this information, the team developed the Atlantic Sturgeon Forecast Warning System, a free, publicly accessible “heads-up” for avoiding costly interactions. This system, which can deliver messages through a web application, online flyers, or text-based updates to a mobile device, alerts interested parties to the risk of encountering sturgeon in the Delaware River and Bay, and even issues a risk forecast three days out."
