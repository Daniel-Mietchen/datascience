# About

This file collects information on data archaeology, data rescue and related matters.

# Definitions

- According to Wikipedia, "[Data archaeology refers to the art and science of recovering computer data encoded and/or encrypted in now obsolete media or formats. Data archaeology can also refer to recovering information from damaged electronic formats after natural or man made disasters.](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Data_archaeology&oldid=882440063)".

Here, I will be using the term in a broader sense of *recovering data from natural or historic records of past events*, e.g. through [Astronomical chronology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_chronology) or [forensic astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_astronomy).

# Examples

* [Measurement of the Earth's rotation: 720 BC to AD 2015](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.2016.0404)

* ["century-old glass astronomy plates had revealed a new problem: Some of the more obscure greenhouse gases — especially chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, a class of man-made substances used in refrigerators and spray cans — had proliferated wildly in recent years"](https://web.archive.org/web/20181230140912/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/01/magazine/climate-change-losing-earth.html)

* [Nova observed 48 BC by Chinese astronomers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11515)
  - > "We present the discovery of an emission nebula in the Galactic globular cluster M 22 (NGC 6656) in observations made with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE. We extract the spectrum of the nebula and use the radial velocity determined from the emission lines to confirm that the nebula is part of NGC 6656. Emission-line ratios are used to determine the electron temperature and density. It is estimated to have a mass of 1 to 17×10−5 solar masses. This mass and the emission-line ratios indicate that the nebula is a nova remnant. Its position coincides with the reported location of a 'guest star', an ancient Chinese term for transients, observed in May 48 BCE. With this discovery, this nova may be one of the oldest confirmed extrasolar events recorded in human history."

* Prehistoric solar radiation anomalies: [Tree rings reveal globally coherent signature of cosmogenic radiocarbon events in 774 and 993 CE](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57094208)
  - > "Here we measure the 14C content in 484 individual tree rings formed in the periods 770–780 and 990–1000 CE. Distinct 14C excursions starting in the boreal summer of 774 and the boreal spring of 993 ensure the precise dating of 44 tree-ring records from five continents. We also identify a meridional decline of 11-year mean atmospheric radiocarbon concentrations across both hemispheres. Corroborated by historical eye-witness accounts of red auroras, our results suggest a global exposure to strong solar proton radiation."

# Missing pieces

- Lots of paper documents of the Secret Service of Eastern Germany have been physically shredded to pieces around the time that the Berlin Wall came down and virtually reassambled afterwards. There are multiple resources on this online but I have not gone through them systematically yet.
- I remember from the time of my PhD (2004-ish) a story that some physically broken [phonograph records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record) were read by way of scanning them with laser technology and then reassembling them virtually. Don't have further details at hand, though.
