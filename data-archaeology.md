* [Nova observed 48 BC by Chinese astronomers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.11515)
  - > "We present the discovery of an emission nebula in the Galactic globular cluster M 22 (NGC 6656) in observations made with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE. We extract the spectrum of the nebula and use the radial velocity determined from the emission lines to confirm that the nebula is part of NGC 6656. Emission-line ratios are used to determine the electron temperature and density. It is estimated to have a mass of 1 to 17×10−5 solar masses. This mass and the emission-line ratios indicate that the nebula is a nova remnant. Its position coincides with the reported location of a 'guest star', an ancient Chinese term for transients, observed in May 48 BCE. With this discovery, this nova may be one of the oldest confirmed extrasolar events recorded in human history."

# Missing pieces

I remember from the time of my PhD a story that some physically broken [phonograph records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph_record) were read by way of scanning them with laser technology and then reassembling them virtually. Don't have further details at hand, though.
