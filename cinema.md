    - Deconstruct the skill: decompose it into subskills, in order to practice the most important individual subskills first
    - Do some research to identify what those most important subskills are by skimming relevant literature, course materials and such; try to find out enough to allow you to self-correct as you practice
    - Remove barriers to practice: make it easy to actually sit down and practice, undistracted
    - Pre-commit a useful amount of time (he said at least 20h) of focused deliberate practice
