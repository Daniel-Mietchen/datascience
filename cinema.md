    - We respond to threats that 
      - are visible
      - have historic precedence
      - are immediate
      - have direct personal impacts
      - simple causality
      - caused by an enemy

* [What happens when our computers get smarter than we are? | Nick Bostrom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnT1xgZgkpk) &mdash; suggests that figuring out superintelligent AI is a hard problem, and that making it safe for humanity is harder still, so we should strive to work out the control part as much as possible before we figure out the superintelligence part *per se*, and if we are successful, this new AI might actually be aligned with our values and thus help humanity develop in a way we would approve of.

    - Define a target performance level: Be clear about what you want to learn; define what it looks like if you succeed in learning it
    - Deconstruct the skill: decompose it into subskills, in order to practice the most important individual subskills first
    - Do some research to identify what those most important subskills are by skimming relevant literature, course materials and such; try to find out enough to allow you to self-correct as you practice
    - Remove barriers to practice: make it easy to actually sit down and practice, undistracted
    - Pre-commit a useful amount of time (he said at least 20h) of focused deliberate practice
