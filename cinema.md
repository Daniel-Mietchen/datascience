# Watched
* [Jessica Richman: Why should science be limited to scientists?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lAlnEX4YQg)
  * see also [Only "Scientists" Can Do Science](http://edge.org/response-detail/25504)
* [Tal Danino on using bacteria to cure cancer](http://www.ted.com/talks/tal_danino_we_can_use_bacteria_to_detect_cancer_and_maybe_treat_it#t-243227)
  * uses probiotic bacteria that are genetically modified to produce signal that is detectable through urine color
  * similar approch for therapy, i.e. genetically modified to produce cancer-treating drugs
  * in both scenarios, signal is enhanced through quorum sensing
* [Thomas Goetz: It's time to redesign medical data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCGlWQnzDVE)
   * about how to link patient data to patient's course of action, with thoughts on redesigning the forms that are used to convey the result of clinical diagnostics to patients
* [Isaac Kohane : How can every clinical visit be used to advance medical science?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5O66e8r2QM)
   * starts with a nice analogy to hurrikane information, where available satellite and other data is integrated in almost real time into predictive models that clearly lay out the options people will be facing as a result. Why don't we integrate patient data with people's lifes in the same way?
* [Peter Chiarelli: Accelerating open science and the urgency to act now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz4xa0m1u5o)
  * highlights traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder as major injuries incurred by US soldiers in Iraq
  * discusses research silos
  * demands open science principles to be followed for medical research
