    - > [“There are many kinds of Gods. People usually have two very different Gods in mind when they say the word ‘God’. One God is the cosmic mystery. We don’t understand why there is something rather than nothing, why the Big Bang happened, what human consciousness is. There are many things we don’t understand about the world and some people choose to call these mysteries by the name “God’. God is the reason there is something rather than nothing. God is behind human consciousness. The most characteristic thing about this God is we know absolutely nothing about him / her / it / they. There is nothing concrete. It’s a mystery. This is the God we talk about late at night in the desert as we sit around the camp fire and think about the meaning of life. That’s one meaning of God. I have no problem with this version of God, in fact I like it very much. Then there is another God which is the petty law giver. The characteristic of this God is we know a lot of concrete things about that God. We know what he thinks about female dress code, we know what he think about sexuality, we know what he feels about food, about politics. This is the God people talk about when they stand around while burning a heretic. We will burn you because you did something that God doesn’t like. It’s like a magic trick. How do you know God exists?  Well, the Big Bang and human consciousness and science can’t explain this and that, and then like a magician swapping one card for another, they will take out the mystery God and replace it with the petty law giver and you end up with something strange like because we don’t understand the Big Bang, women must dress with long sleeves and men shouldn’t have sex together. What’s the connection?  How did you get from here to there?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw9P_ZXWDJU&lc=UgwwKsVrmh60G19xAUB4AaABAg)

* [A simple and smart way to fix climate change | Dan Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0k2-SzlDGko)
  - Why climate change can wreck our soul?
    - Refers to [Svante Arrhenius' 1896 paper on the effect of CO2 on global warming](https://doi.org/10.1080/14786449608620846)
  - Why do we all ignore it?
    - We respond to threats that 
      - are visible
      - have historic precedence
      - are immediate
      - have direct personal impacts
      - simple causality
      - caused by an enemy
    - Climate change does not fit these patterns
    - But our perception on the matter is changing
      - while some see it as "simply" an environmental issue, more and more are realizing that this is an issue with economic, social, political, security and other ramifications
  - How can we fix the disconnect?
    - "There's a way to do it that almost everybody will like"
      - Carbon tax
        - nicely explained
      - The question is not whether climate legislation will happen but whether it will happen in time before major climate tipping points are reached

* [Wikimedia Research Showcase - July 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIV26lWrD9c) &mdash; on [Wikipedia and COVID-19](https://twitter.com/WikiResearch/status/1282704993808723969)
  - the first presentation by Denise Smith is essentially a summary of her paper "[Situating Wikipedia as a health information resource in various contexts: A scoping review](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0228786)", published in February 2020, which concluded
    - > The literature positions Wikipedia as a prominent health information resource in various contexts for the public, patients, students, and practitioners seeking health information online. Wikipedia’s health content is accessed frequently, and its pages regularly rank highly in Google search results. While Wikipedia itself is well into its second decade, the academic discourse around Wikipedia within the context of health is still young and the academic literature is limited when attempts are made to understand Wikipedia as a health information resource. Possibilities for future research will be discussed.
    - in the Q & A at around 30 min, she mentions that a university &mdash; the University of British Columbia came to her mind, but she wasn't sure &mdash; has changed tenure and promotion criteria so as to take into account all contributions to knowledge
      - I tried to find anything about the corresponding policy or policy change, but the best I found is this rather classical policy:
        - > a)   Candidates for appointment, reappointment, tenure or promotion, other than those dealt with in paragraph (b), are judged principally on performance in both teaching and in either scholarly activity or educational leadership.  Service to the academic profession, to the University, and to the community will be taken into account but, while service to the University and the community is important, it cannot compensate for deficiencies in teaching, scholarly activity or educational leadership. Tenured appointments are granted to individuals who have maintained a high standard of performance in meeting the criteria set forth below and show promise of continuing to do so.
  - the second presentation is by Giovanni Colavizza about his paper [COVID-19 research in Wikipedia](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.10.087643), for which the code sits at [https://github.com/Giovanni1085/covid-19_wikipedia](https://github.com/Giovanni1085/covid-19_wikipedia), while the abstract is as follows:
    - > Wikipedia is one of the main sources of free knowledge on the Web. During the first few months of the pandemic, over 5,200 new Wikipedia pages on COVID-19 have been created and have accumulated over 400M pageviews by mid June 2020.1 At the same time, an unprecedented amount of scientific articles on COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic have been published online. Wikipedia’s contents are based on reliable sources such as scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially so in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations to a corpus of over 160,000 articles. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at a fast pace, and have cited close to 2% of the COVID-19 literature under consideration. While doing so, they are able to provide a representative coverage of COVID-19-related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that Wikipedia editors on average rely on literature which is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and has been peer-reviewed.
    - in sum, this presentation underlined the importance of the Wikipedia editors active around COVID-19 having had existing networks, mechanisms and expertise to leverage in response to the pandemic

    - Define a target performance level: Be clear about what you want to learn; define what it looks like if you succeed in learning it
    - Deconstruct the skill: decompose it into subskills, in order to practice the most important individual subskills first
    - Do some research to identify what those most important subskills are by skimming relevant literature, course materials and such; try to find out enough to allow you to self-correct as you practice
    - Remove barriers to practice: make it easy to actually sit down and practice, undistracted
    - Pre-commit a useful amount of time (he said at least 20h) of focused deliberate practice
