* [Isaac Kohane : How can every clinical visit be used to advance medical science?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5O66e8r2QM)
   * starts with a nice analogy to hurrikane information, where available satellite and other data is integrated in almost real time into predictive models that clearly lay out the options people will be facing as a result. Why don't we integrate patient data with people's lifes in the same way?
