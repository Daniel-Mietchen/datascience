# About

This file hosts some examples of open science. I have come across many more but never really started to catalogue them. Here, I am not aiming at a catalogue either, just as a newcomer-friendly collection of useful pointers or food for thought.

# Platforms or workflows

* [Just One Giant Lab (JOGL)](https://jogl.io/)
* [Gravitational Wave Open Science Center](https://www.gw-openscience.org/about/)

# History

* ["On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune"](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neptune&oldid=982712332#Discovery)
