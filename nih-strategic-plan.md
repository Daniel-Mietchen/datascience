# About
Following a request from the US Congress, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) are currently working on a 5 year [Strategic Plan](http://www.nih.gov/about/strategic-plan/) and [inviting public feedback][1] by August 16. This process is somewhat separate from strategic plans being developed in the individual Institutes and Centers that make up the NIH.

Not sure what the plan will mean in practice, but supposing it is useful and the process behind it indeed open for public input, I'd like to use this file (originally posted at the [Open Science Stack Exchange beta](http://openscience.stackexchange.com/questions/143/any-open-science-ideas-for-the-nih-wide-strategic-plan)) to entertain some thoughts as to what to submit in order to raise awareness of open science amongst those who are involved with that plan or similar strategic plans developed elsewhere.

Along with some metadata, the form asks for the following information (each with a maximum of 300 words):

 -  Potential benefits, drawbacks/challenges, and areas of consideration for the current framework 
  -  The topic of reproducibility is currently buried as the 6th bullet ("Ensure rigor and reproducibility") in the 6th box ("Enhancing Stewardship") of the framework &mdash; I think it should have a higher visibility, perhaps as part of the "Fundamental Science" box
 -  Compatibility of the framework with the broad scope of the [NIH mission](http://www.nih.gov/about/mission.htm)
  -  especially "to exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science."
 -  Additional concepts in ICO strategic plans that are cross-cutting and should be included in this trans-NIH strategic plan
   - missing in this picture: open science
     - but see recommendation 2 of the [report on NLM Strategic vision](http://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/Report-NLM-06112015-ACD.pdf):
       - "NLM should lead efforts to support and catalyze open science, data sharing, and research reproducibility, striving to promote the concept that biomedical information and its transparent analysis are public"
 -  Comprehensive trans-NIH research themes that have not been captured in the Areas of Opportunity that Apply Across Biomedicine (boxes 2-4)
  - Promote Fundamental Science
    - Basic science is the foundation for progress
    - Consequences of basic science discoveries are often unpredictable
    - Advances in clinical research methodologies stimulate scientific progress
      - advances in almost any X stimulate scientific progress, so this is a tautology, unless perhaps in case it is referring to the spiral nature of research progress
    - Leaps in technology often catalyze major scientific advances
    - Data science increases the impact and efficiency of research
  - Improve Health Promotion and Disease Prevention
    - Importance of studying healthy individuals
    - Advances in early diagnosis/detection
    - Evidence-based interventions to eliminate health disparities
  - Advance Treatments and Cures
    - Unprecedented opportunities on the basis of molecular knowledge
    - Breakdown of traditional disease boundaries
    - Breakthroughs need partnerships and often come from unexpected directions
 -  Components of the Areas of Opportunity that Apply Across Biomedicine that are not applicable to an NIH-wide Strategic Plan
 -  Future opportunities or emerging research needs
  - Provide responders to such RFIs with an option to have their responses made public
  - Make NIH RePORTER more comprehensively open, so that it can be used as a tool to discover research ideas,  data, equipment, software or other resources as well as potential collaborators, mentors, educators
    - think feed of all NIH-funded MRI scans or gene sequences
