# About

This file collects information pertaining to ways in which the interaction between scientific data and journalism could be enhanced, particulary in the context of open research.

# Some thoughts on the topic

* [Opening up research proposals](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/opening-up-research-proposals)  
> We see no principle reason why approaches like embedded journalism would have to remain limited to military contexts, or prohibited to report negative results.  
    * Indeed, the concept of embedding journalists might well be better suited to the research process, and under terms like "[journalist in residence](https://www.google.de/search?q="journalist+in+residence")", such interactions are being explored, though rarely with a focus on data.

* [The Transformative Nature of Transparency in Research Funding](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002027)
> Journalists, museums, or other science communicators could begin to interact with research projects before these even start and embed themselves and their audiences into the research process much more than they can now, thereby facilitating new approaches to public engagement with science. 

* [science communicators as travel guides through the open science landscape](https://soundcloud.com/hackyourphd/daniel-mietchen-sep-17-2014#t=3:00)

* [Science journalism at the end of the line?](http://ways.org/en/blogs/2009/jun/28/science_journalism_at_the_end_of_the_line)  
> Science journalists could enrich their current "scientists found out" reports with some of the "scientists are investigating - let's see how they do it!" variant, or reports on topics like animal rights in research with more pertinent data. Finally, the public would benefit from all of this - shorter research cycles, more efficient use of research funds, and a better understanding of what it actually means when scientists "found out" or "are investigating" something.

# Examples of (mostly science) journalism
## using data

* [The History Of Europe Lies In British People's DNA](http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinekenneally/the-history-of-europe-lies-in-british-peoples-dna)

### close misses
