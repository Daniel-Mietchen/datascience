# About
This page collects information on open collaboration in the context of emergency response or disaster relief efforts. Open here refers to 
* the preparedness of accepting contributions from anyone, making use of the Web
* results being available under open licenses, as per the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/)

The list below contains two main components:
 1. A list of events and open initiatives that were triggered by them.
 2. A list of organizations who have consistently provided emergency responses.

I am particularly interested in the intersection between the two, i.e. organizations that use open approaches and consistently provide emergency responses. My motivation to collect this information is two-fold:
 1. to advance my general understanding under which conditions open approaches are being favoured over closed ones,
 1. to see how my own activities as an open researcher or as a volunteer for open knowledge initiatives like Wikimedia can be integrated with emergency response activities.﻿
