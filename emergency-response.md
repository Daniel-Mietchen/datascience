# About
This page collects information on open collaboration in the context of emergency response or disaster relief efforts. Open here refers to a subset of the digital response that can be characterized by
* the preparedness of accepting contributions from anyone, making use of the Web;
* results being available under open licenses, as per the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/).

The list below contains two main components:
 1. A list of emergency events and open initiatives that were triggered by them.
 2. A list of organizations who have consistently provided emergency responses.

I am particularly interested in the intersection between the two, i.e. organizations that use open approaches and consistently provide emergency responses. My motivation to collect this information is two-fold:
 1. to advance my general understanding under which conditions open approaches are being favoured over closed ones,
 1. to see how my own activities as an open researcher or as a volunteer for open knowledge initiatives like Wikimedia can be integrated with emergency response activities, particularly with the digital response, as I am rarely in a position to respond on the ground.

While I started this repo in an open-ended fashion, it has since evolved a focus on data sharing in public health emergencies, which has been receiving a growing interest lately, as discussed in [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002109). I have also begun to give talks on the subject, e.g. [at SciDataCon 2016](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/SciDataCon2016.md) and [at IMED 2016](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/IMED-2016.md).

  * To avoid having to make this argument again every time we face an outbreak with the potential for becoming a global crisis, we believe the global health community should develop and agree on a framework of principles for sharing data and biologic samples during any such public health emergency. It would be best if the researchers themselves developed such a framework, as the genomics community did in the Human Genome Project."
