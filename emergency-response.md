# About

This page collects information on open collaboration in the context of emergency response or disaster relief efforts. Open here refers to a subset of the digital response that can be characterized by
* the preparedness of accepting contributions from anyone, making use of the Web;
* results being available under open licenses, as per the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/).

The list below contains two main components:
 1. A list of emergency events and open initiatives that were triggered by them.
 2. A list of organizations who have consistently provided emergency responses.

I am particularly interested in the intersection between the two, i.e. organizations that use open approaches and consistently provide emergency responses. My motivation to collect this information is two-fold:
 1. to advance my general understanding under which conditions open approaches are being favoured over closed ones,
 1. to see how my own activities as an open researcher or as a volunteer for open knowledge initiatives like Wikimedia can be integrated with emergency response activities, particularly with the digital response, as I am rarely in a position to respond on the ground.

While I started this repo in an open-ended fashion, it has since evolved a focus on data sharing in public health emergencies, which has been receiving a growing interest lately, as discussed in [this paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002109). I have also begun to give talks on the subject, e.g. [at SciDataCon 2016](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/SciDataCon2016.md), [at IMED 2016](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/talks/blob/master/IMED-2016.md) or [Endangered Data Week 2018](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/events/blob/master/Endangered-Data-Week-UVA-2018.md).

  * To avoid having to make this argument again every time we face an outbreak with the potential for becoming a global crisis, we believe the global health community should develop and agree on a framework of principles for sharing data and biologic samples during any such public health emergency. It would be best if the researchers themselves developed such a framework, as the genomics community did in the Human Genome Project."

  - > The disease proved to be a wakeup call to a chronic lack of even basic medical infrastructure across Latin America. There were no vaccines available, no clinics prepared for the influx of concerned mothers, very few universal family planning services in place, and the high degree of poverty in the regions left many unable to access the most basic of protections, such as mosquito nets.
  - > For organisations like UNICEF, the most immediate challenge was a lack of accurate data on those affected. Without official public records, the organisation was forced to rely on the region's mobile operators that were able to offer data, albeit aggregated and anonymised, on the movements of people. Combined with temperature and poverty data, which showed the most favourable areas for mosquitoes to breed, the information was used to help direct people away from the most dangerous areas.

This high resolution elevation data was supplied within three hours, and used in conjunction with other sensors to identify elevation coordinates, prioritize potential drilling points, identify drainage paths, provide a detailed and inter-active 3D model of the area, and determine alternate routes into the caves to help rescue the boys. NEXTMap One, which was provided for free, is substantially more detailed than the existing elevation data available from commercial and government sources.

  - >  ECDC launched the HEPSA (Health Emergency Preparedness Self-Assessment) tool, in order to support countries in improving their level of public health emergency preparedness. The tool is worksheet-based and is targeted at professionals in public health organisations responsible for emergency planning and event management. It consists of seven domains that define the process of public health emergency preparedness and response: 1) Pre-event preparations and governance; 2) Resources: Trained workforce; 3) Support capacity: Surveillance; 4) Support capacity: Risk assessment; 5) Event response management; 6) Post-event review; 7) Implementation of lessons learned.
