# About
This file hosts metadata about or links to resources that seem relevant for activities covered by this repo, but that have not been incorporated in any of the more specific files yet. The plan is to spend an entire day every now and then on sorting and reading through these resources and putting them into context, be it in one of the more thematically focused files in this repository or elsewhere.

> It is time for science to go agile.  r
> [..]  
> academic publishing [must] move from its current read-only model and embrace a process as dynamic, up-to-date, and collaborative as science itself.  
> [..]  
> What academic literature needs goes deeper than the view of citations as kudos and shout-outs. It needs what software engineers have used for decades: dependency management.  
> [..]  
> An academic publisher worth their salt would also accommodate another pillar of modern software development: revision control. Code repositories, like wikis, are living documents, open not only for scrutiny, censure and approbation, but for modification.  
> [..]  
> A Git repository is the best of top-down and bottom-up, of dictatorship and democracy: its leaders set the purpose and vision, have ultimate control and final say—yet any citizen has an equal right to complain, propose reform, start a revolt, or simply pack their bags and found a new nation next door.  
> [..]  
> Authors need not thank "anonymous readers who spotted errors and provided critical feedback" when those readers' corrections are directly incorporated (with attribution) as differential edits. Those readers need not offer their suggestions as an act of obligation or charity, and they need not go unknown.

> Freed of the practical and economic constraints of print, journals will also need to encompass a far wider range of contribution sizes, just as the unit of publication in mainstream publishing has broken beyond the traditional bounds of a book and now ranges anywhere from a tweet to Wikipedia. With the advent of collaborative online databases, it is now perfectly feasible for a useful contribution to the scientific corpus to be comprised of literally one 'bit' of information. And, given the exponential arc of technological progress, within a decade or two the maximum size of a new scientific contribution may well exceed the sum total of all the scientific data that exist today.

> The goals of the agency are:

    to foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health;
    to develop, maintain, and renew scientific human and physical resources that will ensure the Nation's capability to prevent disease;
    to expand the knowledge base in medical and associated sciences in order to enhance the Nation's economic well-being and ensure a continued high return on the public investment in research; and
    to exemplify and promote the highest level of scientific integrity, public accountability, and social responsibility in the conduct of science.
