# About
This file hosts metadata about or links to resources that seem relevant for activities covered by this repo, but that have not been incorporated in any of the more specific files yet. The plan is to spend an entire day every now and then on sorting and reading through these resources and putting them into context, be it in one of the more thematically focused files in this repository or elsewhere.

> Freed of the practical and economic constraints of print, journals will also need to encompass a far wider range of contribution sizes, just as the unit of publication in mainstream publishing has broken beyond the traditional bounds of a book and now ranges anywhere from a tweet to Wikipedia. With the advent of collaborative online databases, it is now perfectly feasible for a useful contribution to the scientific corpus to be comprised of literally one 'bit' of information. And, given the exponential arc of technological progress, within a decade or two the maximum size of a new scientific contribution may well exceed the sum total of all the scientific data that exist today.
