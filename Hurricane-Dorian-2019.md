## [Hurricane Dorian (2019)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian)

*These notes are very loosely sorted into some preliminary thematic complexes. They were initially roughly chronological but this is not the case any more.*
* [Summary from the Weather Channel](https://weather.com/storms/hurricane/news/2019-09-08-hurricane-dorian-recap-bahamas-united-states-canada) (as of 8 September)
* When I started looking into this storm more closely throughout September 1, 2019, I found nothing particularly new in terms of openness so far but it was interesting to [filter the feed by mentions of data](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23Dorian%20OR%20%23Dorian2019%20OR%20%23HurricaneDorian%20OR%20%23HurricaneDorain)%20AND%20(%22open%20data%22%20OR%20opendata%20OR%20%22open%20science%22%20OR%20openscience%20OR%20visualization%20OR%20dataviz)&src=typed_query&f=live).
