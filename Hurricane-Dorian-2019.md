# About 

This file collects information related to [Hurricane Dorian (2019)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Dorian), with a focus on data-related aspects of it. These notes developed out of a Dorian-specific section in [emergency-response.md](emergency-response.md) and are to be considered in the broader context of the information gathered in that file.

# README

*These notes are very loosely sorted into some preliminary thematic complexes. They were initially roughly chronological but this is not the case any more. Knowing that emergency-related information is rather instable (not just but also on the web), I made an effort to archive the URLs listed here via the Internet Archive's [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org). So if any of the links in here do not work for you any more, you should be able to find a copy of the respective pages over there (unless the website's operator has disallowed web crawler access in their robots.txt or the page scraper timed out).
As of September 10, I am in the process of reorganizing these notes into something a bit more structured and more easy to navigate and digest. Help with this is most welcome.*

# Openness

*Looking into how catastrophic events trigger openness was the reason why I started [emergency-response.md](emergency-response.md), so let's put this first. I will likely transfer some of this back to the other file.*

* When I started looking into this storm more closely throughout September 1, 2019, I found nothing particularly new in terms of openness so far but it was interesting to [filter the feed by mentions of data](https://twitter.com/search?q=(%23Dorian%20OR%20%23Dorian2019%20OR%20%23HurricaneDorian%20OR%20%23HurricaneDorain)%20AND%20(%22open%20data%22%20OR%20opendata%20OR%20%22open%20science%22%20OR%20openscience%20OR%20visualization%20OR%20dataviz)&src=typed_query&f=live).

# Notes

*In this section, I am listing some Dorian-related initiatives or activities that are more of a kind that is common in emergency contexts but not much about openness and thus haven't figured in the examples I have gathered in [emergency-response.md](emergency-response.md) so far*
