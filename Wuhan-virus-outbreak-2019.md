# Open questions

* [Was the Huanan seafood market at the epicenter?](https://twitter.com/suilee/status/1217730098494722048)
  - If so, 
    - what there was it?
      - Which animal was the host from which the virus jumped over?
      - Which humans were the first to be infected?
        - Who was in contact with the infected?
    - When was it?
      - [“Doctors began seeing a new type of viral pneumonia—fever, cough, difficulty breathing — in people who worked at or visited a food market in the suburbs of Wuhan late last month."](https://twitter.com/JamarlinMartin/status/1218396568488988672) (i.e. in December 2019)
  - If not, then what was?

# Scientific culture

* On January 24, 2020, the Washington Post ran a piece specifically on the pace and openness of research on the virus and how it reflects a change in the scientific culture ["Scientists are unraveling the Chinese coronavirus with unprecedented speed and opennessScientists are unraveling the Chinese coronavirus with unprecedented speed and openness"](http://web.archive.org/web/20200131132127/https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2020/01/24/scientists-are-unraveling-chinese-coronavirus-with-unprecedented-speed-openness/)
  - lots of good tidbits there, albeit encumbered by aggressive DRM
    - > “Imagine walking from Chicago to San Francisco, and then imagine taking a plane from Chicago to San Francisco. That’s kind of the difference,” Mesecar said.
    - > He hopes revealing the secrets of how the virus works will help calm the spreading panic. He noted that influenza sickens and kills large numbers of people in the United States and globally each year, but doesn’t trigger a worldwide panic because the risks are understood and a vaccine exists.
    - > “When you don’t understand something, you panic. You have fear. When you gain an understanding, you don’t fear something as much — you know how it’s going to operate,” Mesecar said. “By sharing that information faster ... both research as well as what’s happening on the ground with individuals, I’m hoping that panic and that fear are going to go down.”
