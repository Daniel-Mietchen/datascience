# About 

This file tracks information related to the COVID-19 viral outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. 

These notes were [started](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/commit/7187877698f8640002a1cd1b1f6d59cf6383c219#diff-73fd4c8eea37e48004cbcf4cb85461a4) on January 17, 2020, with an eye on data-related matters, especially data sharing (or the lack of it), as per the more broadly scoped umbrella file, [emergency-response.md](emergency-response.md). By that date, the virus and the disease had not been named, and the outbreak was thought to be largely limited to Wuhan, which explains the name of this file.

Since then, lots of sources of information (and misinformation) on the topic have sprung up, both the virus and the disease have received official names, and I have tried to insert my notes into the Wikimedia ecosystem when appropriate, rather than detailing things here.

Today, public trust in institutions and leaders is fragile, with routine evidence of intentional disinformation by foreign actors and elected officials alike."

He noted that influenza sickens and kills large numbers of people in the United States and globally each year, but doesn’t trigger a worldwide panic because the risks are understood and a vaccine exists.
    - > “When you don’t understand something, you panic. You have fear. When you gain an understanding, you don’t fear something as much — you know how it’s going to operate,” Mesecar said. “By sharing that information faster ... both research as well as what’s happening on the ground with individuals, I’m hoping that panic and that fear are going to go down.”

  - > "Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better."
  - > "But crises can also send societies down darker paths."
  - > "In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit used case studies of disasters – including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina – to argue that emergencies aren’t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain."
  - > "That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming – that they know is already here – and that they want to fight off."
  - > "Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities."
  - > " if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked"

  - some quotes
    - > "“Is there any good reason to do this in person?”"
    - > "Maybe the de-militarization of American patriotism and love of community will be one of the benefits to come out of this whole awful mess."
    - > "The coronavirus pandemic marks the end of our romance with market society and hyper-individualism."
    - > "All faiths have dealt with the challenge of keeping faith alive under the adverse conditions of war or diaspora or persecution—but never all faiths at the same time."
    - > "Plagues drive change."
    - > "The resistance—led by teachers’ unions and the politicians beholden to them—to allowing partial homeschooling or online learning for K-12 kids has been swept away by necessity."
    - > "This is breaking open a medium with human generosity and empathy."
    - > "VR allows us to have the experiences we want even if we have to be isolated, quarantined or alone. Maybe that will be how we adapt and stay safe in the next outbreak."
    - > "Out of necessity, remote office visits could skyrocket in popularity as traditional-care settings are overwhelmed by the pandemic."
    - > "This crisis should unleash widespread political support for Universal Family Care"
    - > "The coronavirus has laid bare the failures of our costly, inefficient, market-based system for developing, researching and manufacturing medicines and vaccines."
    - > "Unlike with tobacco use or climate change, science doubters will be able to see the impacts of the coronavirus immediately."
    - > "Coronavirus is going to force many institutions to go virtual. One that would greatly benefit from the change is the U.S. Congress."
    - > "The widely accepted idea that government is inherently bad won’t persist after coronavirus."
    - > " The coronavirus is this century’s most urgent challenge to humanity. Harnessing a new sense of solidarity, citizens of states and cities will rise to face the enormous challenges ahead such as climate change and transforming our era of historic inequality into one of economic inclusion."
    - > "It’s clear that in a crisis, the rules don’t apply—which makes you wonder why they are rules in the first place. This is an unprecedented opportunity to not just hit the pause button and temporarily ease the pain, but to permanently change the rules so that untold millions of people aren’t so vulnerable to begin with."
    - > "Most of all, we need to remember that public trust is crucial to governance—and that trust depends on telling the truth."
    - > "Expect a political uprising"
    - > "Electronic voting goes mainstream"
