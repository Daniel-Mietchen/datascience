# About 

This file tracks information related to the COVID-19 viral outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. 

These notes were [started](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/commit/7187877698f8640002a1cd1b1f6d59cf6383c219#diff-73fd4c8eea37e48004cbcf4cb85461a4) on January 17, 2020, with an eye on data-related matters, especially data sharing (or the lack of it), as per the more broadly scoped umbrella file, [emergency-response.md](emergency-response.md). By that date, the virus and the disease had not been named, and the outbreak was thought to be largely limited to Wuhan, which explains the name of this file.

Since then, lots of sources of information (and misinformation) on the topic have sprung up, both the virus and the disease have received official names, and I have tried to insert my notes into the Wikimedia ecosystem when appropriate, rather than detailing things here.

The first of these is the need for consistent messaging and trusted sources of information.

Today, public trust in institutions and leaders is fragile, with routine evidence of intentional disinformation by foreign actors and elected officials alike."

He noted that influenza sickens and kills large numbers of people in the United States and globally each year, but doesn’t trigger a worldwide panic because the risks are understood and a vaccine exists.
    - > “When you don’t understand something, you panic. You have fear. When you gain an understanding, you don’t fear something as much — you know how it’s going to operate,” Mesecar said. “By sharing that information faster ... both research as well as what’s happening on the ground with individuals, I’m hoping that panic and that fear are going to go down.”

  - > "In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell, Solnit used case studies of disasters – including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina – to argue that emergencies aren’t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain."
  - > "That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming – that they know is already here – and that they want to fight off."
  - > "Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities."
  - > " if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked"
