# About

This file hosts information regarding sustainability, especially the sustainability of data-related infrastructures. This includes costs as well as business models and associated policy work, e.g. on redundancy and what to delete.

* [ArXiv](https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/culpublic/arXiv+Sustainability+Initiative)
* The Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) in the UK [requires data to be kept available until 10 years after last consultation](https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/about/standards/researchdata/expectations/):
  - "Research organisations will ensure that EPSRC-funded research data is securely preserved for a minimum of 10 years from the date that any researcher ‘privileged access’ period expires or, if others have accessed the data, from last date on which access to the data was requested by a third party; all reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that publicly-funded data is not held in any jurisdiction where the available legal safeguards provide lower levels of protection than are available in the UK."
