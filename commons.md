# About
This file collects information related to the concept of the Commons, both in general and as it applies to the sharing of scientific data and related information at the NIH and beyond.

# General
* Book: [Patterns of Commoning](http://patternsofcommoning.org/contents/)
* [Quote](https://doi.org/10.1038/543615a)
  * > Science is increasingly a collaborative enterprise, but its infrastructure, social and technical, lags behind.

# In the US
* At NIH
  * Overview
    * [Datascience](https://datascience.nih.gov/commons) 
* multiple other agencies (e.g. NIST) have also indicated interest in a "research data commons", and USDA launched their [Ag Data Commons](https://data.nal.usda.gov/) in October 2015 (see also [this presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/csparr/ag-data-commons-a-new-usda-catalog-and-repository-for-agricultural-research-data))
* legal structure: [Benefit corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_corporation)
* [Jefferson Digital Commons](http://jdc.jefferson.edu/)
      * "The Jefferson Digital Commons is a service of Thomas Jefferson University's Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL). The Commons is a showcase for Jefferson books and journals, peer-reviewed scholarly publications, unique historical collections from the University archives, and teaching tools. The Jefferson Digital Commons allows researchers and interested readers anywhere in the world to learn about and keep up to date with Jefferson scholarship."

* [OECD report on Open Science (2015)](https://www.innovationpolicyplatform.org/content/open-science)
  * "Open science in the information age espouses the notion that knowledge created from public research has public good characteristics that go beyond the concept of the “commons” developed in the 18th century, insofar as ICT-enabled access broadens the possibilities to enrich the commons and extend it to a broader range of users.
