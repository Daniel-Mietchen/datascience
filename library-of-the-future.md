# About
This file collects thoughts about the research library of the future as well as about the future of the research library, and anything in between.

# Intro
* library as a space for providing access to recorded knowledge
  * resilience at the library of Alexandria?
  * difference to archives (focus more on documentation)
* access for both humans and machines
  * besides free text, data and software become important
  * artistic license vs standards
* knowledge about anything humans care about, within ethical limits (which may vary around the globe)
* version history

# Alternative structure
## Ten perspectives on the library of the future
* inspired by [the blind men and the elephant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant)
* user-driven
  * service-oriented
* shared resources
* accessibility
  * blind and non-blind don't use different books any more, just different tools to read
  * 24/7, from anywhere, using any of many devices
  * historical role in the democratization of knowledge
* machine-friendly
  * machines are an integral part of knowledge creation, curation and consumption
  * APIs, bots, mining tools, annotation gadgets, accessibility tools
  * machine-assisted translation
  * queriable
  * "human API" (Mechanical Turk?)
* confluence of GLAMs
  * not just books but any kind of media
  * anchor for citizen science (think drones for fieldwork)
* building for physical objects and collections thereof, otherwise digital
  * online vs. offline
  * indoors vs. outdoors
* knowledge center
  * learning and teaching center
    * cultivating awareness of ways to handle knowledge
  * discovery center
  * space for cognitive adventures
* standard-conscious
  * standard-compliant
  * standard-enforcing
* silence
  * place for focused work or study
* collaboration
  * participatory
  * exchange of ideas
  * networking
  * practice of knowledge-related skills
  * maker spaces
* free vs. open
* spontaneity vs. schedule
