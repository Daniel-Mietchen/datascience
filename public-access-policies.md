  * > You must make any data, original code or materials that underpin published research findings accessible to other researchers at the time of publication. This long-standing requirement extends across all our funded research – from basic science to clinical trials.
  * > In situations where research data is relevant to a current public health emergency, you must share data and other outputs at the earliest opportunity.  In line with the 2016 statement on [data sharing in public health emergencies](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/statement-data-sharing-public-health-emergencies), we require you to share quality assured interim and final data as rapidly and widely as possible, irrespective of the timing of journal publication.
  * > You should take reasonable steps to ensure that your outputs are discoverable to potential users, are deposited in recognised community repositories wherever these exist, and have persistent identifiers, such as DOIs, to enable their use to be cited and tracked.

  * "Open science in the information age espouses the notion that knowledge created from public research has public good characteristics that go beyond the concept of the “commons” developed in the 18th century, insofar as ICT-enabled access broadens the possibilities to enrich the commons and extend it to a broader range of users.
