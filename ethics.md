# Guidance on ethics procedures

* Many institutions issue guidance on ethical matters and the processes set in place to handle them. Some examples:
  * [Oxford Brookes University: Guidelines for informed consent](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/Research/Research-ethics/Guidelines-for-informed-consent/)

# Data on the ethics process for a given research project or publication ..

* .. is scarce, with a few exceptions, e.g.
  * [Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Database for Registered IORGs & IRBs, Approved FWAs, and Documents Received in Last 60 Days](http://ohrp.cit.nih.gov/search/irbsearch.aspx?styp=bsc)
  * [Ethics panel blocks proposed Zika vaccine research](https://www.statnews.com/2017/02/28/zika-vaccine-ethics-panel/)
