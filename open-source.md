# About
This file hosts ideas around free and open-source software, especially as it relates to research data.

# Examples
## Code repositories
* Where should code of NIH-funded software go?
* [Google Code closed](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) and recommends migration to GitHub, BitBucket, SourceForge.
* self-hosting 
  * Git ([example](https://git.wikimedia.org/)) 
  * see also Federated Wiki ([example](http://daniel.asia.wiki.org/))

## Programming competitions
* Worth thinking about [MathWorks' computer programming contest](http://mathworks.com/matlabcentral/contest/), which used an  allowed contestants to borrow each others' code, as described [here](https://books.google.de/books?id=afqfFW8WV9cC&pg=PA60&lpg=PA60&dq=MathWorks%27+computer+programming+contest&source=bl&ots=p-zsUKqiCG&sig=Yqf_WXEUZNItX8DSggut3PwT_6I&hl=en&sa=X&ei=u8PSVJTRNsWt7ga0joHgBg&ved=0CEUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=MathWorks%27%20computer%20programming%20contest&f=false) and [here](http://www.starchamber.com/gulley/pubs/tweaking/tweaking.html).
  * Some quotes: 
    * "What if there were a contest that more accurately modeled the way ideas really move through the world? Suppose, once an idea had been put forward by one person, it could then be freely adopted and modified by anyone else even as the contest is still running? "
    * "Our contests resemble a wiki in the sense that anyone can modify any of the code on display. As with wikis, the result is a fertile meeting of the minds, and a model for successful collaborative design. "
* Code Jams, e.g. [at Google](https://code.google.com/codejam)
