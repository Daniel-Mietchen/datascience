# Potential dimensions of pledges

* diversity (e.g. [manels](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/time-end-manel-tradition))
* ethics
* openness
* sustainability (e.g. as per [Position Statement on Economic Growth](https://steadystate.org/act/sign-the-position/read-the-position-statement/), which I signed on 28 June 2019)
* cover all aspects of research, teaching and academic community service
* collaboration (e.g. dependencies on behaviour of others)
  - distinguish between roles in collaboration (e.g. PI, first author)?
* community service (e.g. reviewing)
* patents?
* FAIR
  - e.g. ORCID

# Potential features of pledges

* version controlled
* simple
* modular
* easily forkable
* regular (e.g. annual) review
* openly licensed
* have some obligatory components
* allow for publicly documented exceptions
  - e.g. as in [this vision for a scientific journal of the future](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:Journal_of_the_future&oldid=1838552#Core_criteria), which states:
    - > "Flexibility: Innovation is stifled by inflexible rules. Exceptions to the above rules are possible if justified in public."
* be integrated into strategies around hiring, promotion, diversity, reproducibility, FAIR etc.
* contain provisions for regular (yearly or so) review
* transition phase

# Open issues
* How to integrate pledges with applicable workflows
  - forms for operationalizing values
  - badges as in some journals for data sharing
  - contracts
  - evaluation rubrics
  - openness facilitates reporting
