# Potential dimensions of pledges

* diversity (e.g. manels)
* ethics
* openness
* cover all aspects of research, teaching and academic community service
* collaboration (e.g. dependencies on behaviour of others)
* community service (e.g. reviewing)
* patents?

# Potential features of pledges

* version controlled
* simple
* modular
* easily forkable
* regular (e.g. annual) review
* openly licensed
* have some obligatory components
* allow for publicly documented exceptions
* be integrated into strategies around hiring, promotion, diversity, reproducibility, FAIR etc.
* contain provisions for regular (yearly or so) review
* transition phase

# Open issues
* How to integrate pledges with applicable workflows
  - forms for operationalizing values
  - badges as in some journals for data sharing
  - contracts
  - evaluation rubrics
  - openness facilitates reporting
