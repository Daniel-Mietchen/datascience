# About

*This file collects materials related to pledges and similar aspirational statements regarding values like sustainability, openness, diversity and ethics, particularly in the context of research, teaching and academia.*

**Update: There is now a dedicated repo at [https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/pledges) that contains information about pledges I made. I will try to move more information from here to there.**

# Potential levels of pledges

* Moved over to pledges FAQ.

# Potential dimensions of pledges

* [Values](https://humetricshss.org/our-work/values/) and how well we live up to them, or even [how we rank them](http://www.allourideas.org/value-ecology)
* diversity (e.g. [manels](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/who-we-are/nih-director/statements/time-end-manel-tradition))
* ethics
  - signed the [Data Values and Principles](https://datapractices.org/manifesto/) on August 5, 2020
  - [similar proposed oath](https://teachdatascience.com/oath/)
* openness
* sustainability (e.g. as per [Position Statement on Economic Growth](https://steadystate.org/act/sign-the-position/read-the-position-statement/), which I signed on 28 June 2019)
* cover all aspects of research, teaching and academic community service
* collaboration (e.g. dependencies on behaviour of others)
  - distinguish between roles in collaboration (e.g. PI, first author)?
* community service (e.g. reviewing)
* patents?
* FAIR
  - e.g. ORCID

# Potential features of pledges

* version controlled
* simple
* modular
* easily forkable
* openly licensed
* have some obligatory components
* allow for publicly documented exceptions
  - e.g. as in [this vision for a scientific journal of the future](https://en.wikiversity.org/w/index.php?title=Wikiversity:Journal_of_the_future&oldid=1838552#Core_criteria), which states:
    - > "Flexibility: Innovation is stifled by inflexible rules. Exceptions to the above rules are possible if justified in public."
* be integrated into strategies around hiring, promotion, diversity, reproducibility, FAIR etc.
* contain provisions for regular (yearly or so) review &mdash; GitHub does it [semi-annually](http://web.archive.org/web/20200805040931/https://github.com/github/site-policy#how-often-will-github-review-these-policies)
* transition phase

# Open issues
* How to integrate pledges with applicable workflows
  - forms for operationalizing values
  - badges as in some journals for data sharing
  - contracts
  - evaluation rubrics
  - openness facilitates reporting
