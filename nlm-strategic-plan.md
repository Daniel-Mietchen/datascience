# About
The US [National Library of Medicine (NLM)](https://github.com/Daniel-Mietchen/datascience/blob/master/nih-strategic-plan.md) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is [requesting information](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-LM-17-002.html) in relation to the strategic plan it is developing. This builds on a set of broad recommendations for the future of NLM that were compiled in a [2015 report](https://acd.od.nih.gov/reports/Report-NLM-06112015-ACD.pdf).

This file contains the free-text parts of my response to the Request for Information. Along with requesting some metadata, the form asked the following questions (**in bold**) and provided additional comments above each form field (which I have set *in italics* here).


**Please provide input on topics within any or all of the four themes below.**

**1)  Role of NLM in advancing data science, open science, and biomedical informatics**

*Identify what you consider an audacious goal in this area – a challenge that may be daunting but would represent a huge leap forward were it to be achieved.  Include any proposals for the steps and elements needed to reach that goal.*

*The most important thing NLM does in this area, from your perspective.*

*Research areas that are most critical for NLM to conduct or support.*

*Other comments, suggestions, or considerations, keeping in mind that the aim is to build the NLM of the future.*

**2) Role of NLM in advancing biomedical discovery and translational science**

*Identify what you consider an audacious goal in this area – a challenge that may be daunting but would represent a huge leap forward were it to be achieved.  Include input on the barriers to and benefits of achieving the goal.*

*The most important thing NLM does in this area, from your perspective.*

*Research areas that are most critical for NLM to conduct or support.*

*Other comments, suggestions, or considerations, keeping in mind that the aim is to build the NLM of the future.*

**3) Role of NLM in supporting the health of nation: clinical systems, public health systems and services, personal health**

*Identify what you consider an audacious goal in this area – a challenge that may be daunting but would represent a huge leap forward were it to be achieved.  Include input on the barriers to and benefits of achieving the goal.*

*The most important thing NLM does in this area, from your perspective.*

*Research areas that are most critical for NLM to conduct or support.*

*Healthcare systems and public health arenas in which NLM participation is most critical.*

*Other comments, suggestions, or considerations, keeping in mind that the aim is to build the NLM of the future.*

**4) Role of NLM in building collections to support discovery and health in the 21st century**

*Identify what you consider an audacious goal in this area – a challenge that may be daunting but would represent a huge leap forward were it to be achieved.  Include input on the barriers to and benefits of achieving the goal.*

*The most important thing NLM does in this area, from your perspective.*

*Research areas that are most critical for NLM to conduct or support.*

*New data types or data collections anticipated over the next 10 years.*

*Other comments, suggestions, or considerations, keeping in mind that the aim is to build the NLM of the future.*
