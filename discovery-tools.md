  - [From the About page](http://www.cyverse.org/about): 
    - "Vision: Transforming science through data-driven discovery."
    - "Mission: Our mission is to design, deploy, and expand a national cyberinfrastructure for life sciences research, and to train scientists in its use."

# Posters
* Recommendation engines fed with poster metadata could provide for an electronic equivalent of [Thematic poster walks](http://www.northseaconference.be/en/conference-format/).
