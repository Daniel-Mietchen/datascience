# About
This file helps to collect information about ways in which research funding could be made more open. 

# Scope
The scope here, for the time being, is any aspect of the funding process, starting from the first inception of an idea, includes the grant drafting, submission and reviewing procedures as well as announcements about awards, calls or any communications about the progress of funded projects or their assessment, as well as long-term archival and citations or other forms of reuse of the research outputs produced from some specific line of funding.

General outlines of ideas in this regard are available through
* [Opening up research proposals](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/opening-up-research-proposals)  
and
* [The Transformative Nature of Transparency in Research Funding](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002027).

Some platforms that already open up some aspects of the funding process are described in the following posts:
* [Wikimedia grants](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants)
   * [Funding Free Knowledge the Wiki Way - Wikimedia Foundation Participatory Grantmaking](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Funding_Free_Knowledge_the_Wiki_Way_-_Wikimedia_Foundation_Participatory_Grantmaking.pdf)
* [Journal of Brief Ideas](http://beta.briefideas.org/all)
* [Introducing ThinkLab — A platform for massively collaborative open science](http://thinklab.com/blog/introducing-thinklab-a-platform-for-massively-collaborative-open-science/38)
   * [ThinkLab as a vetting system for traditional grants](http://thinklab.com/discussion/thinklab-as-a-vetting-system-for-traditional-grants/58) 

The educational value of open grant proposals is highlighted in
* [How to find grant proposal samples?](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1652/how-to-find-grant-proposal-samples),  
which also links to numerous examples of grant proposals that have already been made public.
