# About
This file helps to collect information about ways in which research funding could be made more open. 

# Scope
The scope here, for the time being, is any aspect of the funding process, starting from the first inception of an idea, includes the grant drafting, submission and reviewing procedures as well as announcements about awards, calls or any communications about the progress of funded projects or their assessment, as well as long-term archival and citations or other forms of reuse of the research outputs produced from some specific line of funding.

General outlines of ideas in this regard are available through
* [Opening up research proposals](https://www.newschallenge.org/challenge/2014/submissions/opening-up-research-proposals)  
and
* [The Transformative Nature of Transparency in Research Funding](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002027).

Some platforms that already open up some aspects of the funding process are described in the following posts:

The educational value of open grant proposals is highlighted in
* [How to find grant proposal samples?](http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/1652/how-to-find-grant-proposal-samples),  
which also links to numerous examples of grant proposals that have already been made public.

* [Reminder About Your Responsibilities in Maintaining the Integrity of NIH Peer Review](http://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/06/18/responsibilities-integrity-peer-review/)
   * "We all share the same objective: ensuring a fair review, free of bias, so that the most meritorious applications are identified for funding consideration by NIH. The peer review system belongs to the entire biomedical research community, not just to NIH — let’s do all we can as a community to preserve its integrity."

   * "Baseline funding, in which each researcher gets the same amount per year (Gordon, 1993; Poulin and Gordon, 2001). This protects each scientist from peer review. It is open to the objection that some scientists will do nothing useful with the money, and so it needs some modest checks and balances, such as requiring a public accounting of what research was accomplished. It also underfunds expensive research."
* [Collective allocation of science funding: from funding agencies to scientific agency](http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1067)
   * "We investigate a class of funding models in which all participants receive an equal portion of yearly funding, but are then required to anonymously donate a fraction of their funding to peers. The funding thus flows from one participant to the next, each acting as if he or she were a funding agency themselves. Here we show through a simulation conducted over large-scale citation data (37M articles, 770M citations) that such a distributed system for science may yield funding patterns similar to existing NIH and NSF distributions, but may do so at much lower overhead while exhibiting a range of other desirable features.
