# About
This file hosts information regarding data management plans and how they could be made machine readable. Data management plans are typically created on a per-project basis in the framework of a grant application. They describe what kind of data are to be generated during the project, how they are going to be stored, analysed, protected, long-term preserved, or made accessible to other researchers or the public. Machine readability has not been much of a concern so far but is beginning to attract interest.
