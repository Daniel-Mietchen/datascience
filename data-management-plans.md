# About
This file hosts information regarding data management plans and how they could be made machine readable. Data management plans are typically created on a per-project basis in the framework of a grant application. They describe what kind of data are to be generated during the project, how they are going to be stored, analysed, protected, long-term preserved, or made accessible to other researchers or the public. Machine readability has not been much of a concern so far but is beginning to attract interest. Likewise, in projects that started out with a data management plan, there seems to be no real follow-up in terms of how well the actual research aligned with the original data management plans.

* We already know about predicatble events like [comets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Comets), [solar eclipses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Solar_eclipses), [monsoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsoon), [pitch drops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_drop_experiment) or [Monarch butterfly migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly_migration). How does this predictability affect research around those topics as opposed to research on less predictable events like the approval of a Zika vaccine?
