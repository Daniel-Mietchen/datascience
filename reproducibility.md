# About
This file collects information related to the reproducibility and replicability of research outcomes. Since the two concepts are often mixed up, here are brief definitions: reproducibility is concerned with retracing a particular study and mapping its methodology to its outcomes, whereas replicability is about independent verification of research outcomes using different set-ups.

    * quote: "Can bad scientific practices be fixed? Part of the problem is that no-one is incentivised to be right. Instead, scientists are incentivised to be productive and innovative. Would a Hippocratic Oath for science 
help? Certainly donâ€™t add more layers of research red-tape. Instead of changing incentives, perhaps one could remove incentives altogether. Or insist on replicability statements in grant applications and research papers. Or emphasise collaboration, not competition. Or insist on preregistration of protocols. Or reward better pre and 
post publication peer review. Or improve research training and mentorship. Or ..."
