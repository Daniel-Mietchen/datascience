# About
This file collects information related to the reproducibility and replicability of research outcomes. Since the two concepts are often mixed up, here are brief definitions: reproducibility is concerned with retracing a particular study and mapping its methodology to its outcomes, whereas replicability is about independent verification of research outcomes using different set-ups.
