# About

This file collects information related to the reproducibility and replicability of research outcomes. Since the two concepts are often mixed up, here are brief definitions: 
* reproducibility is concerned with retracing a particular study and mapping its methodology to its outcomes, whereas  
* replicability is about independent verification of research outcomes using different set-ups.

    * quote: "Can bad scientific practices be fixed? Part of the problem is that no-one is incentivised to be right. Instead, scientists are incentivised to be productive and innovative. Would a Hippocratic Oath for science 
help? Certainly don’t add more layers of research red-tape. Instead of changing incentives, perhaps one could remove incentives altogether. Or insist on replicability statements in grant applications and research papers. Or emphasise collaboration, not competition. Or insist on preregistration of protocols. Or reward better pre and 
post publication peer review. Or improve research training and mentorship. Or ..."

    * quote from page 2: "Another useful shift would be for the scientific community, and especially funders, to recognize replication as an essential step of the knowledge-building process, and to provide both incentives and support for efforts to reproduce published results. As long as “important” scientific work is viewed narrowly — be the first across the finish line to a brand new discovery — efforts to reproduce already-reported findings will be viewed as lower priority. If it can be seen as the valuable intellectual labor it is (because, given all the ways it can go wrong, *replication is hard*), more scientists may see it as labor worthy of their time, effort, and creativity."
